# Indigo Engine

Custom 2D/3D game engine written in C++ and Vulkan.

## Overview
This project is a custom game engine written in C++ using Vulkan.  
The goal is to build a clean, modular architecture for rendering, input, and resource management.  

The engine will be used as a foundation for future game projects.

## Goals

- Clean and simple architecture
- Vulkan-based rendering
- Separation of data and rendering logic
- Expandable for future features
